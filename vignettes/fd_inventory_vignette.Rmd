## Forest Inventory Data
The `fd_inventory()` script within `fortedata` currently includes one function:

* `fd_inventory()` returns a single dataset of the forest inventory data, including diameter-at-breast height (DBH), latitude, longitude, and biomass for each measured stem, as well as information on vitality and canopy position . There are 3165 observations in the dataset, all measured in 2018.

```{r fd_inventory}
fd_inventory()
```
