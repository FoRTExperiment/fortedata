## Abstract
The `fortedata` package is an open data notebook that includes data from the Forest Resilience and Threshold Experiment (FoRTE)--a coupled model and field manipulative experiment that directly tests the impact of varying levels of disturbance severity on C cycling dynamics in forested ecosystems. This package is not only aimed at the broader ecosystem science and C cycling communities, but is meant to serve as a central resource for the FoRTE project team. This represents a new way of approaching science that increases transparency and reproducibility, with the additional benefit of streamlining the integration of heterogeneous data streams to both minimize errors and increase research efficiency through internal sharing  for the project team. 

## Introduction

Disturbance alters multiple carbon (C) cycling processes and, as a result, may erode forest C uptake and storage. The magnitude, timing and duration of changes in the C cycle following disturbance vary among forests. While the underlying causes are largely unknown, C cycling responses may differ as a function of disturbance severity, source, and frequency along with the physical and biological properties of the affected ecosystem [Amiro et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2012]. Understanding which forest ecosystems are most vulnerable to disturbance and, conversely, what characteristics convey C cycling stability, remains an important frontier crucial to forecasting changes in the terrestrial C sink in the face of rising global disturbance [Frelich and Reich 1999; White and Jentsch 2001; Woodall et al. 2013. 

Honing the prediction of forests’ response to changing disturbance regimes requires the quantification of multiple C stocks and fluxes, and parallel examination of the mechanisms leading to their stability or decline. The calculation and interpretation of forest ecosystem C balance requires repeated measurements of aboveground C stocks and fluxes through tree and litterfall inventories and belowground processes including root production and soil respiration--the total CO2 efflux from roots and microbes. Complementary process and structural measurements such as leaf physiology, morphology and chemistry along with remotely sensed measures of canopy structure and physiology provide important ancillary data useful to the interpretation of changes in C fluxes following disturbance. Large-scale manipulative experiments may be particularly useful to identify the C fluxes and drivers that determine ecosystem C balance following disturbance [Gough et al. 2013; Shiels and Gonzalez 2014; Fahey et al. 2020 ]. Few comprehensive datasets from such experiments exist in the public domain, however, limiting researchers’ ability to test hypotheses related to forest resilience and functional change.

An “open data” movement in science continues to grow, emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and the moral imperative of making publicly-funded research data broadly available (refs). A specific example of this is open science notebooks for projects, with the goal of generating, integrating, and reporting heterogeneous data streams. This concept has several advantages. Open-notebook science creates transparency with detailed provenance from conceptualization to publication which in turn increases the potential for reproducibility [Schapira et al. 2019; Powers and Hampton, 2019]. Open-notebook science not only increases the utility of data to the external community, but also to the internal community: collaborators, students,and lab members who are directly involved in the project. The ability for a team to pull from one well-documented and consistent source can greatly increase research productivity and efficiency. While we envision the `fortedata` package being of broad interest to the C cycling and ecosystem science communities, its greatest contribution may be to the project team itself--streamlining the process of data curation and manipulation such that the time each individual may have spent repeating mundane tasks can be reappropriated, and errors that might have been introduced from multiple copies of datasets across multiple workstations avoided entirely. New approaches such as open-science notebooks are thus a natural extension of open science.

The goal of this manuscript is to (i) describe the scientific context and goals of the Forest Resilience and Threshold Experiment (FoRTE), (ii) describe its experimental design and high-level measurement protocols, and (iii) document the open-source `fortedata` package that serves as the project data repository. 

## The FoRTE Project Description

FoRTE is a coupled model and field manipulative experiment located in northern, lower Michigan at the University of Michigan Biological Station (45.58 N,  84.71 W). FoRTE spans a total of 8 ha that includes regionally representative landforms and forest types. 

FoRTE follows a hierarchical structure. There are four replicates (A, B, C, D) of four plots (0.5 ha each) for a total of 16 plots. Within each replicate, each plot is randomly assigned a disturbance severity level of 0, 45, 65, or 85% gross defoliation, respectively, with each replicate having one plot per each assigned severity level. For example, A01 - 85%, A02 - 45%, A03 - 65%, and A04 - 0%. Each plot is bisected such that each half subjected to a different disturbance treatment, either a top-down treatment (T) where targeted trees include the largest trees (based diameter-at-breast-height (DBH)), or bottom-up (B), where targeted trees include the smallest trees by DBH--with an 8 cm DBH cut-off, meaning trees larger than 8 cm. A subplot (0.1 ha) is located in each half of each plot for a total of 32 subplots. The standard nomenclature for these subplot units is a concatenation of the replicate (A, B, C, D,) plot number (01, 02, 03, 04) and subplot (E for east side of the plot, or W for the west side of the plot). Unless specifically indicated, these subplots serve as the unit of analysis and are referred to in the data by the variable name of `SublotID` (Fig. 1). Within each subplot there are measurement locations termed nested plots. Nested plots 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 represented measurement points located at plot center (0), as well as 10 m off plot center at cardinal directions (1 = north, 3 = east, 5 = south, and 7 = west). These locations include areas where soil water content, soil temperature, soil CO2 efflux, and hemispherical imagery are taken--this list is meant to be illustrative, not entirely inclusive. Nested plots 2, 4, 6, and 8 are 4 m2 vegetation survey plots that are located 8 m from plot center at intercardinal directions (2 = northeast, 4 = southeast, 6 = southwest, and 8 = northwest). Stem counts and understory physiology measurements are taken at these nested plots. 

Further description of the FoRTE project, including detailed methodologies for each dataset, will be available in subsequent manuscripts (See sections below on Versioning and Archiving as well as the internal function `fd_publications()` which returns a list of FoRTE related publications.)

## The FoRTE Data Package

`fortedata` is a data package that includes field data from FoRTE. Data currently in this package include: leaf physiology, canopy structural traits, soil respiration, litterfall, micrometeorology, and forest inventory and biomass data for the years 2018 and 2019. During the life cycle of this project these datasets will be augmented and additional datasets and data products added. 

As of this writing (`r Sys.Date()`) the current version of `fortedata` is `r packageVersion("fortedata")`.

## Accessing FoRTE data


### Using the R package

It is necessary to install and use the `fortedata` R package in order to access FoRTE data.
This provides a robust framework, including dedicated access functions, dataset and database
report generation, and QA/QC (see below).




```
devtools::install_github("FoRTExperiment/fortedata")
library(fortedata)
```

A specific release number may also be installed:

```
devtools::install_github("bpbond/cosore@v0.4") ##### flag here
```

Datasets are available via user-facing functions:

* `fd_inventory()` returns a single dataset of the forest inventory data, including diameter-at-breast height (DBH), latitude, longitude, and biomass for each measured stem, as well as information on vitality and canopy position (Table S4). There are 3165 observations in the dataset, all measured in 2018 (Fig. 2). 
* `fd_soil_respiration()` returns a single dataset of 2780 observations each of soil CO2 efflux (μmol CO2 m-2 s-1), soil temperature (°C; integrated from 0 to 7 cm depth), and volumetric water content (%) for the year 2019 (Figs. 3, 4; Table S5).
* `fd_leaf_spectrometry()` returns a single dataset of vegetation indices derived from leaf-level spectrometry data collected via a CI-710 handheld spectrometer (Table S6). The package includes 7155 observations of spectral indices for three species each in eight subplots within the D replicate (Figs. 1 and 4).  
* `fd_photosynthesis()` returns a single dataset of leaf physiology variables, including photosynthesis, transpiration, etc, measured using a LI-6400 XT (LI-COR Biosciences; Lincoln, NE)(Table S7). The package includes 2215 observations from 2018 (Fig. 4). 
* `fd_litter()` returns a single dataset of litter mass collected via litter traps (four in each subplot, at nested sampling points 1, 3, 5, 7). The data include the tare + oven-dried mass of leaves as well as the tare weight (the empty bag), by species, by subplot (Table S7). The data also include notations for “CWD”, the collection of coarse woody debris (e.g. sticks, branches), and “MIX”, fragments of leaves too small to identify to the species levels as well as other missed organic fragments in the basket. Litter mass can be calculated by subtracting the tare weight from the mass + tare. There are a total of 340 observations included in the package from 2018. 
* `fd_hemi_camera()` returns a single dataset that includes derived estimates of leaf area index, gap fraction, clumping index, and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from terrestrial, upward-facing hemispherical photos looking into the forest canopy taken 1 meter above-ground (Table S9). The data package includes 1028 observations of each variable from 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 4).
* `fd_canopy_structure()` returns a single dataset that includes estimates of canopy structural traits such as height, area/density, openness, complexity, and arrangement derived from terrestrial lidar and processed using  forestr version 1.0.1 (Atkins et al. 2018) in R Version 3.6.2 (R Core Team, 2020). The package includes 62 observations for each metric (28 canopy structural metrics are included in forestr v1.0.1 that estimate canopy structural traits such as area/density, openness, arrangement, heterogeneity, and layering (Atkins et al. 2018; Fahey et al. 2019)) from 2018 (Table S10).  
* `fd_par()` returns a single dataset that includes estimates of the fraction of photosynthetically available radiation (faPAR) absorbed by the canopy as well as leaf area index (LAI_cept)--each derived from a handheld ceptometer (LP-80; Decagon Devices)(Table S11). The package includes 32 observations of each variable from 2019 and 16 from 2018 (Fig. 4). 

* `fd_inventory()` returns a single dataset of the forest inventory data, including diameter-at-breast height (DBH), as latitude, longitude, and biomass for each measured stem. Biomass is calculated from species specific allometries included in `biomass_allometry_table.csv` within `fortedata`. 


Brief summaries of certain datasets are available via summary functions: 
* `fd_inventory_summary()` returns a summary of the `fd_inventory()` dataset that includes stocking density (in stems per ha) and mean basal area (m2 per ha) averaged at the subplot level (n = 32) grouped by `Replicate`, `Plot`, and `Subplot` variables.
* `fd_lai_summary()` returns a summary of the `fd_lai()` dataset that includes keaf area as leaf area index (m2 m-2) averaged at the subplot level (n = 32) grouped by `Replicate`, `Plot`, and `Subplot` variables.
