Description: Data and analysis scripts from the Forest Resilience Threshold Experiment (FoRTE). FoRTE
    is a manipulative ecosystem experiment testing the effects of varying disturbance severity levels on
    ecosystem strcuture, funciton, and resistance, reslience, and recovery. In 2019, over 3750 trees 
    were experimentally stem-girdled and the subsequent effects on carbon, water, and nutrient cycling processes 
    have been monitored. This package includes associated data and analysis to support this project.
