\description{
Hemispherical camera data.
}
\note{
Data were collected by Jeff W. Atkins and Evan Pari using a 24 Megapixel
Sony 6000 DSLR Compact 2571 camera (Regent Instruments; Quebec, QU, Canada) with a
180Â° hemispherical lens. The blue channel of the camera is replaced with a near-infrared
channel, which allows direct calculation of NDVI.
